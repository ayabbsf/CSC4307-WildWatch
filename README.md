## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload images containing potential wildfire scenes.
- **Camera Input**: Users can use their phone's camera to capture and analyze images in real-time.
- **Fire and Smoke Detection**: Our application uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect fire and smoke in images.
- **Geolocation**: If available, the application displays the GPS coordinates of the image, helping emergency services locate the fire.
- **Weather Information**: Users can access potentially crucial weather data related to the detected fire's location, including wind speed and direction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to use.
